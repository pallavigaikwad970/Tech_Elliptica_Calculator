  @sanity @div_positive
  Scenario Outline: To verify if the calculator can correctly divide two integer numbers <Dividend> and <divisior>
    When the user enters the <First> number
    And user hit "/" operator
    And the user enters the <Second> number
    And the user hit the equals "=" button
    Then the result <Result> should be display
  Examples:
            | First    | Second  | Result                 | TestcaseName   |
            | 100      | 20      | 5                      | For 100 and 20 |

            | 20       | 100     | 0.2                    | For 20 and 100 |
            | 100      | 0       |  0                     | For 100 and 0  |
            | 99999    | 0       | 0                      | For 99999 and 0|


  @sanity @div_negative
  Scenario Outline: Verify that the calculator can correctly divide two negative numbers <TestcaseName>
    When the user enters the <First_negative> number
    And user hit "/" operator
    And the user enters the <Second_negative> number
    And the user hit the equals "=" button
    Then the result <Result> should be display
  Examples:
                | First_negative| Second_negative  | Result           | TestcaseName   |
                | -10           | -2               | 5                | For -10 and -2 |
